k-mers were counted withouth canonization using `KMC <https://github.com/refresh-bio/KMC>`_. k-mers length was set to k= {{ snakemake.config["params"]["kmc"]["kmer_len"] }}. The first column represents the number of total reads and the second column represents the number of unique non-canonized k-mers for each accession/sample. For more information about canonization/non-canonization of k-mers counting please refer to `Voichek et al. (2020) <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-020-0612-7>`_.
