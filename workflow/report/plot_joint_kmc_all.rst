Joint plot showing the relationship between the non-canonized unique k-mer counts and the number of reads. X axis represents the number of unique k-mers and the y axis represents the number of total reads. Each point represents a sample. The red line represents the linear regression line. The `r` and `p` values are calculated using The Pearson correlation coefficient with `personr <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.pearsonr.html>`_. The `r` value is the Pearson correlation coefficient and the `p-value` is the two-tailed p-value. The marginal distributions of x and y axis are also shown on the top and on the right side of the plot respectively.
